Instructions for the submission of homeworks
======
There will be several written assignments or homeworks during this semester. Each homework is centered around an application and will also deepen your understanding of the theoretical concepts. Homeworks should be written up clearly and concisely. You may lose points if your answers are unclear or unnecessarily complicated. Homeworks should be submitted in the form of scanned-copy to Moodle under filename *HW\*Studentname_ID*.

**Late policy for assignment submission**

Homeworks must be submitted by the Nur-sultan time specified at the time of the homework. They must be submitted to the proper place in Moodle on the announced due date. In case Moodle does not work, homeworks need to be submitted by email to your instructors and teaching assistants by the same time and day as specified in the homework. 

**You will be penalized 20% of points per day late**. Therefore, in any cases of illness or family emergency, you must inform your instructor immediately if you believe you will not be able to submit your homework on time. In such cases, an exception may be made at the discretion of your instructor.
