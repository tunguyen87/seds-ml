Instructions for the submission of assignments
======
There will be several assignments during this semester. These assignments will mainly involve building out prototypes for applications that we will discuss in class. Each assignment might contain both written and programming parts which will deepen your understanding of the theoretical concepts. The written part should be written up clearly and succinctly; you may lose points if your answers are unclear or unnecessarily complicated. Also, they must be scanned (or typed) and submitted as PDF.

The programming part will contain an .ipynb ipython notebook file that will guide you through the assignment. This file will ask you to code up functions in other *\*.py files*. All the instructions necessary for the assignment are contained in these *assignment\*.ipynb* files.

All the python and PDF files we ask you to code up must be submitted to Moodle.

**Late policy for assignment submission**

Assignments must be submitted by the Nur-sultan time specified at the time of the assignment. They must be submitted to the proper place in Moodle on the announced due date. In case Moodle does not work, assignments need to be submitted by email to your instructor by the same time and day as specified in the assignment. 

**You will be penalized 30% of points per day late (or 5% of points per 4 hours)**. Therefore, in cases of illness or family emergency, you must inform your instructor immediately if you believe you will not be able to submit your assignment on time. In such cases, an exception may be made at the discretion of your instructor. In addition, live grading will be done if the instructor feels that the assignment is a result of plagiarism.
