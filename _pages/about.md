Spring 2021

Instructor: [Prof. Nguyen Anh Tu](https://tunguyen87.github.io/homepage)
======

- **Classtime:** Tuesday and Thursday 10:30-11:45
- **Class location:** Online
- **Office hours:** TBA
- **Email:** tu.nguyen@nu.edu.kz

Course Description
======
During this course students will be introduced to a variety of machine learning algorithms and techniques. Particular emphasis will be placed on understanding the theoretical basis. By the end of the course, students will be able to derive most commonly used methods mathematically from first principles and therefore have a firm grasp of the underlying theory. In addition, students will also be asked to implement various machine learning techniques from scratch in python during coding tutorials and thus also learn practical applications of the theoretical concepts.

**Due to COVID-19, this spring we will be conducting the course solely online... there will be no "in person" meetings. The online materials which I have created are the primary content for the course, and your primary interactions with the instuctor will be via Piazza.**

Course aims
======
The aims of the course are:
1.	familiarize students with most common machine learning techniques. These will include techniques from supervised learning as well as unsupervised learning.
1.	to enable students identify the right method of analysis for any type of dataset 
1.	to apply a suitable method and interpret it’s outcome meaningfully
1.	to understand the benefits and limits of a specific technique

Course learning outcomes 
======
By the end of the course the student will be expected to be able:
1.	have the required mathematical basis to study machine learning
1.	to derive a whole range of machine learning techniques from first principles
1.	to understand their theoretical basis and assumptions these may have
1.	to implement a range of machine learning techniques themselves in python from scratch
1.	to identify appropriate techniques for a given dataset
1.	to validate their approach, e.g. by means of cross-validation
1.	to understand the bias-variance trade-off (i.e. overfitting/underfitting) 

Pre-requisites
======
A good working knowledge of Python, Linear algebra, Vector calculus, and basic probability/statistics (i.e., MATH 273 and MATH 321).

Course materials
======
The primary course resources are provided online via the CSCI 447 webpages which contain video lessons, lecture slides, practice exercises, notes, and further readings created by the instructor, as well as links to off-site resources.

We will also be using the Piazza platform for handling general questions and answers from students.

We do not have a regular textbook for the course, though the following may be used as an occasional reference:

Course structure
======
This semester, the course will be completely online. The pages linked from the “Lecture Schedule” page provide materials for the individual lessons, which consist of on-line videos and/or readings.  Given that we do not have in-person lectures to help keep you on schedule, you will need to pay particular attention to when you need to go through the posted lesson materials according to the schedule, and properly pace yourself. Since we do not have in-person lectures, students are primarily responsible for getting help from the instructor (or TAs) when they are having difficulties. The best place to do this in Piazza, either by posting “publically” or “private to instructors”.  Note that you are not allowed to post your own assignment code to Piazza, so such questions must always be “prviate to instructors”.  Also, students are strongly encouraged to take part in discussions on Piazza, and help answer general questions…. just do not post code or give out answers to the assignments.

**Computing tutorials.** The course lecturer will be holding regular Zoom sessions about once a week to guide students how to make use popular tools and implement very basic applications (e.g., handwritten character recognition, face recognition) in machine learning. The skeleton code of the tutorial will be provided in advance. To make the tutorial more effective, the students should go through the provided code and solve it by yourself. Then, during the live sessiosn, we will discuss the possible solutions and analyze the resutls. You can also ask any questions related to the lectures and assignments during this sessions.

**Assignments.** Five assignments will be given every two or three weeks with both written and programming parts. Each assignment is centered around an application and will also deepen your understanding of the theoretical concepts. Particularly, programming assignments will be closely related to the material covered in the lectures. They must be submitted before the given deadline to Moodle, otherwise you will receive no credit for the assignment. If you are caught plagiarizing code from other students, or use code obtained online, or get unauthorized help from others, you will get a zero for the programming assignment. Written assignments should be written up clearly and concisely. You may lose points if your answers are unclear or unnecessarily complicated.

**Presentation.** During the course, each participant will have to present a specific topic in machine learning. We will use video recording and slides as the way for student to present and share their selected topics. These can be classical/recent research papers and advanced techniques. Students can be as creative as they like for their presentations.

**Final/Midterm exam.** We will be having an online Moodle exam. Students cannot use notes, books, software, or other online materials or aids (e.g., an IDE) during the quiz. In some instances, we may allow the use of scratch paper to help you work out your solutions. The individual quizzes will be cumulative in the material covered up to the current point in the schedule. You will be required to record yourself during the exam so we can see both you and your computer desktop. Further details will be provided on Piazza about how to install the proper software, and what procedures you need to follow. 

Assessment
======
Your final grade will be calculated as follows:
- Assignments: 35%
- Presentation: 10%
- Midterm Exam: 20%
- Final Exam: 35%

Final letter grades will be assigned using the following:
- A :     95 or above
- A-:    90 up to 95
- B+:    85 up to 90
- B :    80 up to 85
- B-:    75 up to 80
- C+:    70 up to 75
- C :    65 up to 70
- C-:    60 up to 65
- D+:    55 up to 60
- D :    50 up to 55
- F :    0 up to 50
